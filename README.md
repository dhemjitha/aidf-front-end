# HirelyAI

HirelyAI is an AI-powered job evaluation platform that helps recruiters and job seekers connect efficiently. Instead of traditional resume matching, HirelyAI assesses applicants based on their responses to a series of questions and provides an AI-driven evaluation of their suitability for a role.

## 🌍 Real-World Problem & Solution

### 🔍 The Problem
Recruiters often struggle to assess candidates beyond their resumes, making it difficult to determine their true potential. Meanwhile, job seekers may not effectively communicate their skills in a traditional resume format, leading to missed opportunities. Manual screening also takes significant time and effort, delaying the hiring process.

This streamlines the hiring process, reduces bias, and ensures better candidate-job alignment.
